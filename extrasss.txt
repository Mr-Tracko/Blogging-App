here we used partials in views folder -
//partial are the some some parts of the code .. which are common in many many files .. and instead of pasting it into
the different different files .. we can directly take the reference from that particular ejs part of th e partial folder
..

//partial is a special feature of ejs components.

here , we installed nodemon by -
npm i nodemon -D   -> -D because it will come in a seperate filder i.e. devdependencies .. that helps to decrease the size of module .
kyuki deployment k time p hmaari dev depencies install nhi hogi , jiski vjah se hmaare project ka size km rhega

here , we created two scripts in package,json - 
dev is used when we are making
and start is used at the time when we will be doing the production , bcz there we don't have to restart our server again and again
